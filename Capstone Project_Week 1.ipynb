I believe that an ice cream shop will be better located if it is close to a large number of restaurants and bars in addition to tourist attractions such as museums and parks. In oder to choose the best location in Manhattan I will use the **explore** function from the Foursquare API to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. I will also use scatter plots to help me with my decision."
